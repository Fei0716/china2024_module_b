The Fourvière Nights
01/06/2025
Since 1946, Les Nuits de Fourvière has brought together audiences on its terraced seating beneath the stars. Each summer in June and July, the festival returns the ancient theatres to their original function, as venues for the performing arts, including music, dance, opera, drama and circus. While in Paris, artists dream of seeing their name on the bill at L'Olympia, in Lyon, they yearn to perform at Les Nuits de Fourvière!
