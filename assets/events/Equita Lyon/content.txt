Equita Lyon
30/10/2024
The Equita Lyon Western Horse Show and Oklahoma ring, which are already the proud hosts of the NRHA European Derby since 2017, will host a qualifier this year for The Run For A Million, the reining event with the highest prize purse in the world. A historic event, as Lyon will be the first and only qualifier held outside the USA. A tremendous opportunity for European reining too. Already well-represented in the NRHA European Derby, Lyon will now give the discipline's elite a chance to rank among the world's best in August 2024, in Las Vegas, for The Run For A Million event.
