Les Tupiniers du Vieux Lyon
14/09/2024
Every year, on the 2nd weekend in September, the Tupiniers du Vieux-Lyon (Old Lyon Ceramics Fair) brings together around 120 ceramists in Place Saint-Jean and the surrounding streets. In 2024, it will be the 39th edition of the Tupiniers du Vieux Lyon. The exhibition features collections of ceramics and culinary pottery on loan from museums all over France. These works evoke the traditions and history of everyday objects, but they also give craftsmanship a place at the heart of our daily lives by reappearing on our tables and in our kitchens.
