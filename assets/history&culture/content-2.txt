Renaissance and Enlightenment

The Renaissance era brought a wave of elegant architecture, with grand buildings like the Hôtel de Ville (City Hall) and the Place des Terreaux showcasing the period's artistic flair. Lyon became renowned for its silk industry during the 15th century, earning the title of "Silk Capital of the World." Its legacy is evident in the Musée des Tissus et des Arts Décoratifs, which houses a vast collection of textiles. During the Enlightenment, Lyon became a hub of intellectual and scientific thought, attracting prominent figures like Voltaire and Rousseau.
