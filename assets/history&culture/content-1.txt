Roman Roots and Medieval Splendor

Founded by the Romans in 43 BC, Lyon was initially named Lugdunum and served as a major administrative and commercial center. Today, the iconic Roman Amphitheater, a UNESCO World Heritage Site, stands as a testament to its ancient past. During the Middle Ages, Lyon flourished as a center of trade and banking, and its medieval architecture still graces the city's historic districts.
