Bugnes (Angel Wings): Bugnes are typically made with a simple dough of flour, eggs, milk, and butter, and are often flavored with lemon zest or orange blossom water. The dough is rolled out, cut into strips, and then twisted into a distinctive "angel wing" shape before being deep-fried until golden brown.
